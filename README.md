# Swarm-Intelligence
Our task is to enable a robot to find multiple products in the supermarket, which will modeled as a maze. In order to save time and power, the bot should determine the shortest route between a set of product locations to visit.

This problem is usually referred to as the Traveling Salesmen Problem (TSP) and can be solved with a genetic algorithm.

Before it can determine the shortest way to visit all products, the robot should have an idea of what the distance is between these locations. To achieve this, we implemented a swarm intelligence approach. Specifically, pathfinding based on Ant Colony Optimization (ACO).

The Jupyter notebook is in /Assignment2/src/Main.ipynb.
